# 🩺 End-to-End LLM-Based Medical Chatbot using RAG

This project is an end-to-end Medical Question Answering Chatbot built using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).  
The system generates accurate and context-aware medical responses by grounding LLM outputs with information retrieved from a medical knowledge base.

---

## 📌 Project Motivation

Large Language Models can generate fluent responses, but in sensitive domains like healthcare they may hallucinate or provide unreliable information.  
To address this, I implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture where relevant medical documents are retrieved first and then passed as context to the LLM for response generation.

This approach improves:
- Factual accuracy  
- Domain relevance  
- Trustworthiness of responses

## 🔁 Conversational RAG with Memory

This project has been extended from a basic knowledge-based RAG system
to a conversational RAG architecture using LangChain's
ConversationBufferMemory.

### Key Features
- Maintains full chat history across turns
- Supports follow-up medical questions
- Uses ConversationalRetrievalChain
- Non-agentic, deterministic control flow

### Architecture
User → Flask API → Conversational Retrieval Chain
→ (Conversation Buffer Memory + Pinecone Retriever + LLM)
→ Context-aware medical response

-----------
## 🤖 Agentic RAG Architecture

This project has been upgraded from a conversational RAG system to an
Agentic RAG architecture using LangChain agents.

### Key Enhancements
- ReAct-style reasoning loop
- LLM-driven decision making
- Retriever exposed as a tool
- Conversation memory preserved
- Conditional medical knowledge retrieval

### Architecture
User → Flask API → LLM Agent
→ (Conversation Memory + Pinecone Retriever Tool)
→ Grounded Medical Response
